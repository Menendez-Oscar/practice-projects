HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: 
This assumes that Apache Ant has being previosly installed. 
(Using Linux Terminal) Navigate to project folder where build.xml is located and type ant. This will run the build ant script, which will compile the source files including Thing42Test.java(Test class), which are located in the src folder. The resulting .class files will be stored in the bin folder. After compilation the build.xml script will run the junit tests.
